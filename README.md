# NLP-Assisted Subject Indexing

This project proposes a transformer-based system that suggests Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) for books. That is, if I input the text of a book, the system should recommend the according LC Classification metadata. For instance, if I input the text of *Pride and Prejudice*, the system should recommend its **Class** (P - Language and Literature), **Subclass** (PR - English literature), and possible **Subject Headings** (Love stories, Young women, Domestic fiction). 

For training and testing, I collected 50,000+ English eBooks from Project Gutenberg. You can follow [here](https://github.com/mbforbes/Gutenberg) to collect eBooks from Project Gutenberg. As for the metadata, please refer to [Project Gutenberg Catalog Metadata](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/offline_catalogs.html#xmlrdf).
