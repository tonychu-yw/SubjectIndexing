# LC Subject Headings Recommendations

This project proposes a transformer-based system to suggest subject headings for books. That is, if I input the text of a book, the system should recommend the according LC Classification metadata. For instance, if I input *Pride and Prejudice*, the system should recommend **Class**: P - Language and Literature, **Subclass**: PR - English literature, and possible **Subject Headings**: Love stories, Young women, Domestic fiction.
